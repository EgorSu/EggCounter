## About the project.
The algorithm is implemented for counting eggs on a conveyor In this project.
Steps implemented in this algorithm:
- remove the background of the image
- counting the length of a sequence of non-zero pixels vertically and horizontally and composing a function of this length from a coordinate
- calculating the derivatives of this function and determining the points of the beginning and end of the egg, as well as the points of contact of this egg with neighboring eggs
- separating eggs in contact and counting the total number of eggs
